## PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION
*"Classify and detect plant leaf diseases using AI-powered deep learning"*

---

### 🔗 Objectives:

- Classify plant leaf images into specific disease categories  
- Use real-world dataset for training (Potato: Early Blight, Late Blight, Healthy)  
- Build a lightweight CNN model using MobileNetV2  
- Evaluate performance using Accuracy and F1 Score  
- Predict disease from user-uploaded leaf images  
- Enable easy testing and future deployment  

---

### 🔍 Features:

- Deep learning classification using Keras/TensorFlow  
- Pretrained MobileNetV2 as the base model (Transfer Learning)  
- Data augmentation for improved generalization  
- Real-time image upload and prediction  
- Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, F1 Score, and Classification Report  
- Simple and Colab-compatible workflow  

---

### 🛠️ Programming language used: Python  
### 📚 Libraries used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, sklearn, Matplotlib, PIL  
### 🗂️ Dataset used: Plant Disease Dataset by Akshit Gupta (Kaggle)  

---

### 📊 Evaluation:

- Accuracy: ~42%  
- F1 Score (macro): ~32%  
- Correctly predicted: Potato___Early_blight from uploaded image  
- Performs best on disease classes with balanced data  

---

### 🌱 Future Project Perspective:

- Improve model performance using advanced CNNs like ResNet and EfficientNet  
- Build a mobile app to capture and classify diseases via camera (Android/iOS)  
- Enable offline predictions using TensorFlow Lite  
- Create a dashboard with visual analytics for farmers and agri-scientists  
- Extend support to more crops (e.g., Tomato, Maize, etc.)
